This Power BI dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of sales and financial performance using data from an Excel dataset.
It covers important business aspects like total sales, profits, profit margins, and discounts. The dashboard includes visual elements
such as bar charts, line graphs, and KPI cards to help users quickly understand trends. It tracks how sales and profit vary by product,
country, and customer segment over time. For example, it highlights that some products generate high profits even with fewer sales, and
that discounts can reduce overall profit margins. The dashboard also shows how different customer segments and countries perform, with
segments like corporate and countries like the USA standing out. Filters and slicers allow users to explore the data by segment, region,
or time period. The insights gained from this dashboard support smarter business decisions, such as focusing on high-margin products,
adjusting discount strategies, and targeting underperforming areas. Overall, it enables better planning and performance tracking for both sales and finance teams.
